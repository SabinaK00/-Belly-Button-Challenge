I created an interactive dashboard that visualizes OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit) data using D3.js. The dashboard includes a bar chart showing the top 10 OTUs for each individual, a bubble chart displaying OTU distribution, and a demographic info panel with metadata about the selected individual. I built this project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON, and it is fully responsive, updating dynamically based on user interaction.
